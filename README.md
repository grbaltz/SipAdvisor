## STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

App created by Garrett Baltz, begun Oct 19 2023

SipAdvisor provides a simple way of keeping track of alcohol consumption through the day with a simple logging method for each drink taken.

Fun features include:
- Day-by-day tracker of average alcohol consumption, including visual indicators as to whether you are drinking above average or not
- Weekly/Monthly trackers for similar functions, designed to see your progress over time
- Ability to specify rewards for yourself should you meet a desired goal

Furthermore, SipAdvisor also highly encourages water consumption alongside alcohol (given alcohol is bad and I have 1 kidney). Due to this,
SipAdvisor also provides a water tracking feature that competes with your alcohol consumption, shown through a little colored race at the bottom
of the screen.
